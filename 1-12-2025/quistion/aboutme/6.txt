I build Modern, Scalable, and Intelligent Systems.

I am a Software Architect and Full-Stack Developer focused on transforming ideas into product-grade digital platforms. My philosophy is simple: Code That Works Smoothly —merging design clarity with engineering depth to create systems that adapt, grow, and enhance human creativity.


# Core Focus

I specialize in three core pillars:


🌐 High-Performance Web Systems: Building full-stack applications with an emphasis on speed and clean architecture. Highly skilled in Svelte 5, React, Node.js, SaaS/API design, and serverless deployment.

📱 Cross-Platform Mobility: Delivering beautiful, reliable, and high-performance mobile and web applications using Flutter & Dart.

🛠️ Intelligent Automation: Crafting custom tools, AI-enhanced workflows, browser extensions, and specialized scripts (Puppeteer, Python) that automate meaningful tasks and run efficiently at scale.


# Architecture & Expertise

I thrive on leading projects from idea to deployment, ensuring robust, scalable architecture and exceptional user experiences.

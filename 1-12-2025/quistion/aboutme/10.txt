My expertise now revolves around the MERN stack, where I leverage MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js to create dynamic, responsive, and scalable web applications. I also bring robust front-end development skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with back-end experience in PHP and MySQL from earlier projects. Beyond web development, I have hands-on experience building desktop applications using C# .NET Windows Forms (WinForms) App.
